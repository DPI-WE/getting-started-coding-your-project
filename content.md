# Getting Started Coding Your Project

<div class="mt-2 alert alert-warning">

Before getting started, make sure you have already submitted a functional specification and gotten approval from an instructor.

Start with a blank Rails application by generating a repository based on [our rails-7-template](https://github.com/new?template_name=rails-7-template&template_owner=appdev-projects).

Enter `bin/dev` in terminal to start your web server after the setup completes.

**A**lways **B**e **C**ommitting.

I encourage you to use an Industrial Git Flow (feature branches with pull requests) even though you will likely be the only developer on this project.

We encourage you to tag an instructor, teaching assistant or classmate to review a pull request and give you feedback.
